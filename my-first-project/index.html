                <p>Upon seperation from the rock the creature seems lost and moves non-stop. The team of scientists is trying to discover its life time span. It was the only creature found on the surface at the moment. Through experiments, the creature seems to be 1000000 years old, formed from a star collision all those years ago.</p>

                In 1901, a galaxy rock landed on earth and scientists immidiately took to examine any sign of life. They scratched off some sample material from its surface and brought it back to the lab. To their astonishment they looked through the microscope and found a moving creature. They began to wonder... What can it do? How does it evolve? Can it grow...?
